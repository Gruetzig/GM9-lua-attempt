# GodMode9 but with lua

A simple test... Includes Lua 5.4.6 with a few changes for compile-time warnings

copy init.lua to the root and then run "run.gm9" to use it

Before you think about using this: it doesn't even have an API or a proper way to run the code. This is currenetly ONLY a test to see if Lua can be used at all.
